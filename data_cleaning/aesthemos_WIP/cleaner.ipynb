    "AESTHEMOS (based on this):\n",
    "This is the meat of this project. This is a measure that evaluates the subject's aesthetic experiences of each of the paintings they view. There should be about 66-67 paintings they view, and for 8 different categories of emotion, the subject gives a score between 1-7 based on intensity of that emotion.\n",
    "There are 7 different form files, one for each different gallery (because it was too big to put in one form ): They are in questionnaires>Google Forms>AESTHEMOS\n",
    "We want to divide all the paintings into one of 5 categories based on each individual's ratings: High Arousal Positive Valence, High Arousal Negative Valence, Low Arousal Positive Valence, Low Arousal Negative Valence, and Indifferent. This is calculated by:\n",
    "Sort the paintings by the \"Indifference\" score. The top 10 with the highest Indifference scores will be part of the 'indiff' group.\n",
    "Take out the 'indiff' group. Using the remaining paintings, create an \"Arousal\" measure which is the sum of ['a. Moved']+df['b. Fascinated']+df['c. Funny']+df['d. Surprised']\n",
    "Sort paintings by Arousal; split in half. The ones with higher arousal scores go in the high arousal group, the ones with lower arousal scores go in the low arousal group.\n",
    "Within each of those arousal groups, sort by \"Unsettling\". Split in half. If the Unsettled score is low, it's in the positive group, if it's high, then it's in the negative group. \n",
    "At this point you should have the 5 groups: hiPos, hiNeg, loPos, loNeg, and indiff. Create a csv that has a row for each painting and these columns: Painting Title, Artist, Gallery number, Unique ID, and the name of the Group it's in, as well as a column for each of the original measures on their ratings. I've attached a file called 'pilot02-groups-2-titles.csv' for reference; ultimately we want a file for each participant that looks like that but also includes all of the original ratings. The name of the file should be 'pilot__-groups.csv'\n",
    "I have a Python script that I've used in the past that I can share with you if you like, but it was written for a different style of input (not a Google Form export) and also it's a mess haha. "
